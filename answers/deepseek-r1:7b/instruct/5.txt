Alright, I want to help this user book a flight to Seattle from Los Angeles. First, I need to check the current prices on popular airlines between LAX and SEA. United Airlines is usually reliable, so I'll mention their options first.

Next, I should consider different class options—economy, business, first class—and explain how each affects cost and comfort. It's also good to note the layover times in case they're sensitive to travel duration.

I wonder if they have specific dates or preferences. Maybe they're flexible but looking for a quicker trip. I'll suggest checking multiple airlines like Southwest or American Airlines as options, just in case prices vary.

Also, peak season might be a factor—summer is usually more expensive. They should look at their preferred travel times to see if that affects layover duration.

I should include tips on booking early, checking for discounts, and confirming the flight details once they pick an airline. This way, they have a comprehensive guide to make the best decision.
