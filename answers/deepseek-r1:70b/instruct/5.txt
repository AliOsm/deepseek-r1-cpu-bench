Okay, so I want to help someone book a flight for four people to Seattle in the U.S., but I'm not exactly sure where to start. Let me think through this step by step.

First off, I know that booking flights usually involves knowing some key details. The user mentioned they're traveling with three other people, making it four travelers in total. So, I should probably ask about their travel dates—when are they planning to go? Are the dates flexible or fixed? Flexibility can sometimes lead to better deals.

Next, where are they flying from? Knowing the departure city is crucial because flight prices and availability can vary a lot depending on the origin. Maybe they're coming from another U.S. city or perhaps an international location. I should also check if all four travelers have their passports and necessary visas, especially if it's an international trip.

Seattle has two main airports: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and Paine Field (PAE). SEA is the bigger one and more likely where they'll land, but it's good to confirm. They might prefer a specific airport or have a location in mind once they arrive, which could affect their choice.

Budget is another important factor. Without knowing how much they're willing to spend, it's hard to recommend options. I should ask for their budget range. Also, do they have any preferences about airlines? Some people like certain airlines for their service or loyalty programs.

Do they need a round-trip flight, or is it one-way? Round-trip is usually cheaper and makes more sense if you're returning, but maybe they're planning an open-ended trip. It's worth clarifying.

They might also have specific travel class preferences—economy, premium economy, business, or first class. Each has different prices and amenities, so knowing this can help narrow down options.

How about the time of booking? Sometimes booking early gets better deals, but last-minute bookings might have unexpected offers too. I should check what the current prices are looking like for their travel dates.

If they're flexible with dates, maybe suggesting alternative days could save them money. Mid-week flights sometimes cost less than weekend ones. Also, considering nearby airports if SEA is too expensive or booked up.

I can use flight comparison sites like Google Flights or Skyscanner to look for deals. These sites often show the cheapest options and let you compare different airlines. Sometimes flying into an alternative airport near Seattle might be cheaper, but then they'd have to factor in ground transportation costs from there to their final destination.

Once I find some options, I should check each airline's baggage policies since that can add to the cost. Some include a checked bag, others charge extra. Also, if any of the travelers have special needs or require assistance, like wheelchair accessibility, that should be communicated when booking.

After gathering all this info, I can present them with a few options—maybe three different choices with varying prices and flight details. They can then decide which one fits their plans best.

I think it's also important to remind them about any travel restrictions or COVID-19 requirements for domestic travel, though I believe in the U.S., most restrictions have been lifted. Still, checking the latest guidelines wouldn't hurt.

Lastly, once they choose a flight, they'll need to provide all travelers' details accurately—names as per passports, contact information, etc. Making sure everything is correct avoids issues later on.

So, putting it all together, I should ask for their departure city, travel dates flexibility, budget range, round-trip or one-way preference, class of service, and any airline preferences they have. With that info, I can start looking up flights and present them with the best options.
