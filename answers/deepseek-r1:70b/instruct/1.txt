Okay, I need to write a step-by-step guide on how to bake a chocolate cake from scratch. Let's start by gathering all the necessary information.

First, I'll list out the ingredients required for both the cake and the frosting. For the cake: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, eggs, milk, oil, vanilla extract, water or coffee. For the frosting: butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, milk, vanilla extract.

Next, I should outline the tools needed—like mixing bowls, electric mixer, measuring cups, 9-inch pans, etc.—so that someone has everything ready before starting.

Now, for the instructions. Preheating the oven is crucial; it needs to be at 350°F (175°C). Then, preparing the pans with parchment paper or grease and flour ensures the cake doesn't stick.

Mixing dry ingredients first makes sense—flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, salt. In another bowl, combine wet ingredients: eggs, milk, oil, vanilla extract, water/coffee. Once those are mixed, they should be added to the dry ingredients until just combined. Overmixing can make the cake dense.

Pouring the batter into pans and smoothing the tops is next. Baking time is about 30 minutes, but I'll note that a toothpick test can check doneness. Letting the cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack is important to avoid breaking.

For frosting, creaming butter and powdered sugar first, then adding cocoa and vanilla, adjusting consistency with milk. Assembling the cake by placing one layer on a plate, spreading frosting on top, adding the second layer, and frosting the outside gives a nice finish.

Tips like using coffee for depth of flavor or letting the cake cool completely can help someone achieve better results. Cleaning up as you go is practical advice to make the process smoother.

I should make sure each step is clear and concise so that even someone without much baking experience can follow along easily.

- **Frosting:**
  - 1 cup unsalted butter (softened)
  - 3 cups powdered sugar
  - ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
  - 4 tablespoons milk
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

#### **Tools Needed:**
- Mixing bowls (large and medium)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Ensure the racks are in the middle to allow even baking.

2. **Prepare Pans:**
   - Grease two 9-inch round pans with cooking spray or butter, and line bottoms with parchment paper for easy removal.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together flour (2 cups), sugar (1 cup), cocoa powder (½ cup), baking powder (2 tsp.), and salt (1 tsp.). This ensures even distribution of ingredients.

4. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a medium bowl, mix eggs (4), milk (1 cup), oil (½ cup), vanilla extract (2 tsp.), and water/coffee (1 cup). Stir until smooth.

5. **Blend Mixtures:**
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture. Mix on low speed with an electric mixer or whisk until just combined. Avoid overmixing to prevent a dense texture.

6. **Bake Cakes:**
   - Divide batter evenly between prepared pans, smoothing tops. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool Cakes:**
   - Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Use a knife or leveler if needed to even layers.

8. **Prepare Frosting:**
   - In a large bowl, cream butter (1 cup) and powdered sugar (3 cups) until fluffy. Add cocoa powder (¼ cup), milk (4 tbsp.), and vanilla extract (2 tsp.). Mix until smooth; adjust consistency with more milk if needed.

9. **Assemble Cake:**
   - Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread frosting on top, then place the second layer over it. Frost the sides and top of the cake evenly.

10. **Serve:**
    - Let the cake set for 15 minutes before slicing and enjoying!

### **Tips for Success:**
- Use room temperature ingredients for better mixing.
- Substitute water with coffee to deepen chocolate flavor.
- Cool cakes completely before frosting for a neat finish.
- Clean tools as you go to ease post-baking cleanup.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!
