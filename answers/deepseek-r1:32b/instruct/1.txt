Okay, so I want to bake a chocolate cake from scratch. I've never done this before, but I love chocolate and think it would be fun to try. Let me see... I remember that cakes usually need flour, sugar, eggs, butter, maybe some baking powder or soda, and vanilla extract. But wait, since it's a chocolate cake, I guess cocoa powder is essential here. 

Hmm, the first thing I should do is gather all the ingredients. The user mentioned 2 cups of granulated sugar, 1 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 3 large eggs, 1 1/4 cups of whole milk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. That seems like a solid list.

I need to make sure I have all these items. Maybe I can check my pantry first. Do I have enough sugar? Yes, but maybe the cocoa powder is old... I should check if it's still good. The eggs are fresh because I bought them last week. Milk and oil are there too. Okay, so I'm set on ingredients.

Next step is preheating the oven. It needs to be 350°F (175°C). I remember that ovens can sometimes run hot or cold, so maybe I should check with an oven thermometer if I have one. If not, just keep an eye on the cake as it bakes.

Greasing and flouring two 9-inch round pans. Wait, do I have those? Yes, two round cake pans. I'll use some butter or cooking spray to grease them and then sprinkle a bit of flour inside each pan. That should prevent sticking.

Now, in a large bowl, I need to combine the dry ingredients: sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Let me measure each carefully. The sugar is 2 cups, that's about half a kilogram. The flour, 1 3/4 cups... maybe around 200 grams? I'm not sure, but using the measuring cup should be accurate enough.

Mixing these dry ingredients well so they're fully combined. Maybe sifting them together would help ensure there are no lumps, especially in the cocoa powder since sometimes it can clump.

Then, add the wet ingredients: eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. The user said to mix until smooth. So I need to make sure there's no dry streaks left. But wait, adding everything at once might not be the best idea; perhaps mixing in parts? Or maybe using an electric mixer on medium speed for a minute or two?

I should consider whether to use a hand mixer or stand mixer. Since I don't have a stand mixer, using a hand mixer would work. It's easier to get everything smooth that way.

Once the batter is mixed, pour it into the prepared pans equally. Let me check—each pan should have about half the batter. Maybe 2 cups each? That seems right because the total batter would be around 4 cups if I measure correctly.

Bake for 30-35 minutes. I think this time frame is standard for cakes, but I'll need to keep an eye on it. Maybe start checking after 25 minutes by inserting a toothpick into the center of each cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, they're done.

After baking, let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks. Wire racks are good because they allow air circulation and prevent the bottoms from getting soggy. Cooling completely is important because if I try to frost them while still warm, the frosting might melt or slide off.

Once cooled, it's time to frost. The user said a chocolate buttercream would be perfect. That sounds delicious! So for that, 1/2 cup of unsalted butter needs to be softened. Maybe take it out of the fridge about an hour before making the frosting so it softens nicely. Then add 2 cups of powdered sugar and 3 tbsp cocoa powder. Mix until smooth.

Gradually adding milk or cream to get the desired consistency—thicker for spreading, thinner if I want something more pourable. Maybe start with 1-2 tbsp and adjust as needed.

Frosting between layers and on top—I need to make sure each layer is even. Maybe place one cake layer on a plate, spread frosting on top, then add the second layer, and then cover the whole thing with frosting.

Letting it set in the fridge for about 30 minutes is a good idea so the frosting firms up nicely. After that, I can decorate if I want—maybe some sprinkles or fresh berries.

Wait, what if something goes wrong? Like if the cake doesn't rise properly... Maybe I didn't mix enough, or the baking powder was old. Or perhaps too much oil made it dense. Hmm, but following the recipe closely should help avoid that.

Also, ensuring even distribution of batter in the pans is important so both layers bake evenly. If one pan has more, it might take longer to cook, causing unevenness.

Oh, and making sure not to overmix after adding wet ingredients—otherwise, the cake could become tough. Gently mixing until just combined should be enough.

I think that's about it. I'm a bit nervous because baking can be tricky, but taking it step by step and following each instruction carefully should lead to success. Maybe I'll have some chocolate cake with my friends later!
