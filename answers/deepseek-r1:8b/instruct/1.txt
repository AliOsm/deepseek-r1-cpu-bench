Okay, so I want to bake a chocolate cake from scratch. Hmm, where do I start? I'm not really experienced in baking, but I've seen some recipes before. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to gather all the ingredients. The recipe mentioned flour, sugar, eggs, butter, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, milk, vanilla extract, and chocolate ganache. Oh right, and chocolate shavings for decoration. So I should check if I have everything at home. Let me see: flour, yes; sugar, yeah; eggs, got two; butter, definitely have that; cocoa powder, yes; baking soda, I think so; salt is there. Milk, absolutely; vanilla extract, no, wait, do I have that? Hmm, maybe I can use a substitute if not. Oh and chocolate ganache—wait, what's that? It's a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream or something, right?

Wait, the recipe says to make the ganache by melting dark chocolate and mixing with heavy cream. Do I have dark chocolate? I usually buy the regular kind, but maybe I can use that if it's all I have. Also, I need heavy cream; do I have that in my fridge? If not, can I substitute it? Maybe whole milk could work, though the texture might be a bit different.

Alright, moving on to the actual cake. The recipe says preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). That seems standard. Then grease and line two 20cm round cake pans or one 23cm springform pan. I don't have springform pans, so maybe just use regular round pans. Also, I need parchment paper; I think I have that.

For the batter, it's 200g flour, 150g sugar, 50g cocoa powder. Wait, 200g flour seems like a lot—does that make a double layer cake? Oh yeah, because it makes two cakes. Then, eggs: four, which is about 2 cups. Butter: 100g. So half a cup of butter melted. Cocoa powder is 50g, so a third of a cup. Baking soda and salt are each a teaspoon. Milk is a cup, vanilla extract—maybe I can use 1 teaspoon if I don't have the extract, but it's better to get some.

So, sifting the flour with cocoa, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Then adding eggs one by one. That might be tricky; I'm not sure if my bowls are big enough. Maybe a large metal bowl is better for folding in the dry ingredients.

After mixing the dry ingredients with the eggs, then adding melted butter. Oh, wait, I can melt the butter in the microwave or in a saucepan. Then add the vanilla and milk. Mixing that until smooth. It should be a thick batter, right? So, pour into the pans and bake for 25-30 minutes. Check with a toothpick; if it comes out clean, they're done.

Wait, but what about the ganache? I need to make that after baking. So melt dark chocolate and heavy cream, let it set in the fridge. Then spread between the layers or on top. Oh, and then sprinkle with chocolate shavings. Got it.

Do I have all the tools? Mixing bowls, spatulas, measuring cups and spoons, baking pans, parchment paper, wire rack to cool the cakes. I think that's covered.

Potential issues: If I don't have heavy cream, maybe use whole milk or even a milkshake if I'm desperate. Also, if I don't have vanilla extract, can I use extra cocoa instead? Probably not as good, but it's an option.

Wait, when melting the chocolate for ganache, should the bowl be over water? Oh right, bain-marie method—so heat water in a saucepan, place the bowl with chocolate and cream on top, stir until melted. That might help prevent scorching.

When adding dry ingredients to wet ones, I need to do it slowly to avoid lumps. Maybe using a whisk or electric mixer would help. But if I'm doing this manually, I have to be careful.

Also, when the cakes are done baking, I should let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before moving them to a wire rack. That helps them set and prevents them from breaking.

Do I need to use two pans or one? If I only have one, maybe split the batter into two portions and bake separately. Or just make one big cake if that's okay.

I think I've covered all steps. Let me recap: gather ingredients, preheat oven, prepare pans, mix dry ingredients, add wet ones, pour into pans, bake, cool, make ganache, assemble, and decorate. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but in the recipe, it says to beat the eggs one by one, which seems a bit tedious. Maybe an electric mixer would work better for a smooth batter. But if I don't have one, I'll need to whisk them in thoroughly.

Also, when adding the dry ingredients, do I sift them with flour? Or mix them together first before adding to the wet mixture. Probably better to combine dry ingredients well first so they don't form lumps later.

I think that's about it. Let me try to outline the steps clearly without missing anything.

To bake a chocolate cake from scratch, follow these organized steps:

### Ingredients:
- **For the Cake:**
  - 200g plain flour
  - 150g sugar
  - 50g cocoa powder
  - 4 large eggs
  - 100g unsalted butter (melted)
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or substitute with extra cocoa)
  - 1 cup whole milk (heavy cream is preferable for ganache)
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 teaspoon salt
- **For the Ganache:**
  - 200g dark chocolate (broken into pieces)
  - 100ml heavy cream (or substitute with whole milk or a milkshake)
  - Chocolate shavings for decoration

### Tools:
- Mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons, spatula, baking pans, parchment paper, wire rack.

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
   - Grease two 20cm round cake pans or one 23cm springform pan with butter.
   - Line the pans with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, sift together 200g flour, 150g sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt.
   - Add 50g cocoa powder and mix thoroughly to combine.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   - In another bowl, whisk 4 eggs until well combined.
   - Add melted butter (heat in microwave or saucepan), vanilla extract, and 1 cup milk. Stir until smooth.

4. **Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   - Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until smooth. Be careful to avoid lumps by folding gently.
   - The batter will be slightly runny; this is normal.

5. **Bake the Cakes:**
   - Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans (about 200ml each).
   - Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

6. **Make Ganache:**
   - In a double boiler, melt dark chocolate and heavy cream over low heat. Stir until smooth.
   - Pour ganache between the cake layers or spread on top of one layer for a filling.
   - Let ganache set in the fridge before using.

7. **Assemble and Decorate:**
   - Once both cakes are cooled and assembled, place them on a serving plate.
   - Spread ganache over the middle layer (if using a layered cake) or top one layer.
   - Sprinkle with chocolate shavings for decoration.

### Tips:
- For an even better texture, use electric beaters for mixing eggs and wet ingredients.
- If without vanilla extract, consider adding extra cocoa powder to enhance flavor.
- Ensure all bowls are grease-free for easy pouring of batter.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake with ganache and decorations!
