Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two main components: a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**, both of which are neural networks. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Generator**: 
   - The generator is responsible for producing new data that resembles the training data distribution.
   - It takes noise (e.g., random vectors) as input and outputs a generated sample.
   - Example: In image generation, the generator might transform random noise into a realistic-looking image.

2. **Discriminator**:
   - The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real data samples and fake ones produced by the generator.
   - It compares the quality of the generated samples with the real data.
   - Example: In fraud detection, the discriminator could determine if transactions are fraudulent or not based on features.

3. **Adversarial Loss**:
   - The adversarial loss function is used to update both the generator and discriminator.
   - For the generator, it aims to minimize the error so that the discriminator cannot distinguish between real and fake samples.
   - For the discriminator, it aims to maximize the error, making it better at detecting fakes.

4. **Gradient Descent**:
   - Both networks (generator and discriminator) are trained using gradient descent techniques.
   - The generator updates its weights to make its outputs indistinguishable from real data.
   - The discriminator updates its weights to improve its ability to detect fake data.

5. **Objective Functions**:
   - The generator's objective is to minimize the probability of being classified as a fake by the discriminator.
   - The discriminator's objective is to maximize this probability, effectively maximizing the difference between real and fake samples.

6. **Training Process**:
   - The training process alternates between updating the generator and the discriminator.
   - This iterative process continues until convergence, where both models achieve their respective objectives.

7. **Applications**:
   - GANs are used in various applications like image generation, text synthesis, fraud detection, and more.

In summary, a GAN comprises two neural networks (generator and discriminator) with adversarial training mechanisms to produce high-quality data samples that are indistinguishable from real data.
