Alright, I need to develop a Python function for solving a Sudoku puzzle. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know Sudoku is a 9x9 grid with some numbers filled in and others empty. The goal is to fill in the empty cells so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating.

First, I should represent the Sudoku puzzle as a list of lists in Python. Each sublist represents a row, and each element can be an integer or None if it's empty. That makes sense because I can easily check for Nones later on.

Next, I think about how to make changes when a cell is filled in. Maybe having a solve function that returns the solved puzzle would be good. But wait, what if there are multiple solutions? Well, Sudoku puzzles usually have only one solution, so I probably don't need to worry about that. 

I should also consider constraints during solving. For example, each row must contain all numbers from 1-9 without duplicates, same for columns and subgrids. So perhaps the backtracking algorithm would work here—trying possible numbers in empty cells and checking if they lead to a valid solution.

Wait, but implementing backtracking might be computationally intensive for very hard puzzles. Maybe I can optimize it somehow? Like choosing the cell with the fewest possibilities first or using some heuristic for selection. That could reduce the number of recursive calls needed.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Input Handling**: Read the Sudoku grid from input and convert it into a 2D list in Python.
2. **Find Empty Cells**: Identify all empty cells (Nones) in the grid.
3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
   - Select an empty cell.
   - Try numbers from 1 to 9 that are not already present in the row, column, or subgrid.
   - For each valid number, place it in the cell and recursively try to solve the grid.
   - If placing a number leads to a solution (no more empty cells), return True.
   - Otherwise, backtrack by resetting the cell to None and trying the next possible number.
4. **Base Case**: When there are no empty cells left, check if the puzzle is solved correctly. If yes, return it.

Wait, but in Python, functions can't modify variables outside their scope unless they're mutable. So, I might need to have a helper function that takes the grid and modifies it in place by returning True or False after solving.

Alternatively, make a copy of the grid each time the backtracking is done and return that as the solved puzzle.

I should also consider edge cases, like when there's only one cell empty. Then I can fill it directly without any constraints from other cells. Another case where multiple options are available for an empty cell—how to handle that efficiently.

Another thought: using itertools for permutations might help in generating possible numbers for each empty cell, but since the order matters and we need unique candidates per row, column, etc., checking each time is better than trying all possibilities upfront.

Wait, maybe I can write a helper function that finds possible candidates for an empty cell by checking its row, column, and subgrid. Then, in the backtracking step, try one of these candidates first.

Putting it all together, the main function will read the input, process it into the grid, then call the solve function. The solve function will use backtracking with the constraints checked as described.

I think I should also test this approach with some sample puzzles to see if it works correctly. Maybe start with a simple one and then try harder ones to check performance.

Wait, but for larger or more complex puzzles, the backtracking might take longer. Perhaps using optimizations like choosing cells with the least possible candidates first would make it faster. That's an optimization I can implement by selecting the cell with the fewest empty possibilities at each step.

In summary, my plan is to structure a backtracking solver that recursively fills in cells and backtracks when a choice leads to no solution. This should handle most Sudoku puzzles efficiently.

To solve this problem, we need to create a function that can solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to fill the empty cells (represented by None) such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

### Approach
The approach involves using a backtracking algorithm with constraint checking. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:

1. **Input Handling**: Read the Sudoku puzzle input, which is typically provided as an array of arrays in Python.
2. **Identify Empty Cells**: Find all cells that are empty (represented by None) and store them for processing.
3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
   - Select an empty cell and determine possible values that can be placed in it without violating Sudoku rules.
   - For each possible value, place it in the cell and recursively attempt to solve the puzzle.
   - If placing a value leads to a solution (no more empty cells), return True. Otherwise, backtrack by resetting the cell to None and trying the next possible value.
4. **Base Case**: When there are no empty cells left, check if all constraints have been satisfied. If they are, return the solved puzzle.

### Solution Code
```python
def solve_sudoku(grid):
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            if grid[i][j] is None:
                return _solve_sudoku(grid, i, j)
    
    return True

def _solve_sudoku(grid, row, col):
    # Find empty cells and their possible values
    empty_cells = []
    candidates = {}
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            if grid[i][j] is None:
                row_nums = set()
                col_nums = set()
                subgrid_nums = set()
                for x in range(3):
                    for y in range(3):
                        num = grid[x*3 + y][i*3 + j]
                        if num is not None:
                            row_nums.add(num)
                            col_nums.add(num)
                            subgrid_nums.add(num)
                possible = []
                for num in range(1, 10):
                    if num not in row_nums and num not in col_nums and num not in subgrid_nums:
                        possible.append(num)
                empty_cells.append((i, j))
                candidates[(i, j)] = possible
    
    for (r, c) in empty_cells:
        for num in candidates[(r, c)]:
            grid[r][c] = num
            if _solve_sudoku(grid, r, c):
                return True
            grid[r][c] = None  # Backtrack
    
    return False

def read_sudoku_input():
    import sys
    puzzle_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    puzzle_lines = puzzle_str.split('\n')
    
    grid = []
    for line in puzzle_lines:
        row = list(map(int, line.strip()))
        grid.append(row)
    
    # Ensure that we only process non-zero rows
    return [list(x) for x in (row for row in grid if max(row) != 0)]

def main():
    grid = read_sudoku_input()
    solved = solve_sudoku(grid)
    if not solved:
        print("No solution exists.")
    else:
        for row in grid:
            print(' '.join(map(str, row)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **solve_sudoku**: This is the main function that initializes the backtracking process. It recursively tries to fill each empty cell and backtracks if a partial solution doesn't lead to a complete solution.
- **_solve_sudoku**: This helper function performs the actual recursion by selecting an empty cell, determining possible values for it, placing values one by one, and recursively solving the puzzle.
- **read_sudoku_input**: This reads input from standard input, processes each line into integers, and returns the grid to be solved. It filters out any rows containing zero since Sudoku puzzles are 9x9 matrices with exactly one solution.

This approach efficiently solves the Sudoku puzzle by systematically trying all possible values while adhering to Sudoku constraints.
