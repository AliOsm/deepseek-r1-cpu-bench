Okay, so I want to fly from New York to Seattle and I'm trying to figure out how to book my tickets. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that flying from NYC to Seattle is pretty common because both are big cities with a lot of tourist attractions. But I'm not exactly sure about the details on booking flights for people from New York.

First off, I think I need to consider how many passengers there are and whether my flight is the cheapest option. Maybe comparing prices between different airlines would help. I've heard that some airlines are cheaper than others, so maybe I should check which ones offer better deals. But wait, sometimes companies might have limited seats or require advance booking. I guess I should look into that as well.

I also remember reading somewhere that having a carry-on bag is important for connecting flights from NYC to Seattle. If I don't bring one, I might need to pay extra when arriving in Seattle. So maybe I should check if my airline requires it and if there are policies about it. Also, booking a carry-on can be cheaper than buying a ticket upfront, so that's something to keep in mind.

I wonder how long the flight takes. From what I know, a direct flight might take 1-2 hours, but maybe with layovers or transfer times, it could add up. If the flight is short and one way, planning ahead for connections might be easier. But if it's longer, maybe I can use transfers from other cities for cheaper options later.

When booking, I should consider which airports in Seattle are more popular or have better deals. Maybe flying into the same airport as my home city could be a good option since there might be limited flights and lower prices. I think the Seattle International Airport (SLK) is one of the most crowded and has a lot of competition, so that's probably where the best deals would be.

Wait, I've heard that some airlines offer flexible departure times or even have early departures during peak hours. That could help if I'm trying to get to Seattle in time for activities like theallophilia festival or other events. But I should check the schedule on the booking site to make sure that's available.

Another thing is whether there are any discounts for students, seniors, or members of certain airlines. Maybe some promotions offer better rates, especially during peak times when more flights become available. I need to look into those as well.

When it comes to the seat selection process, I think you can choose based on your own preferences like seating style or comfort level. That might be a good idea if I'm not sure which seat will fit me best or want to save money by getting a more comfortable option first.

Transportation options could also affect my total cost. If I take a train or bus from NYC to Seattle, that adds extra costs but might give me better flexibility. Maybe checking the pricing for both transportation and the flight together would be smart. Also, some airlines offer connecting flights with reduced prices compared to direct ones, which could save me money.

I should also think about baggage policies. Depending on the airline or country, there might be limits on how many bags I can carry onto the flight. If I have multiple passengers, I might need extra checked bags for each person, but some airlines allow it without extra fees unless they're very strict. That could add up if I'm bringing a lot of luggage.

If I don't know my exact travel dates or times, booking in advance is probably better because the airlines might offer better deals during off-peak seasons. But sometimes people prefer to book later just to avoid any changes on their plans. So maybe balancing both strategies would be good.

Fees are another consideration. Each airline has its own fees for carry-on and checked baggage, as well as late check-in fees. I should make sure I know my exact charges before booking to plan my budget accordingly. Also, international flight taxes can vary depending on where I'm from, so it's important to confirm that in advance.

I think about any potential delays or changes in the schedule. If there are any last-minute issues, I might need to cancel the ticket, which could affect my plans. Maybe looking into flexible payment terms and having a backup plan for change is smart. Also, some airlines offer free baggage pickup if I check in early enough, so that could save me time and money.

Lastly, I should research all the available options online before making a final decision. That way, I can compare multiple airlines, prices, and deals to find the best fit for my needs. Checking reviews and ratings might also give me an idea of how comfortable or reliable each airline is for this trip.
